# ToyGL
TGL is an implementation of a *simple* software renderer, as a lightweight library.  
Features:  
- Textures
- Single header
- Lightweight
- No dependencies
- Objectively better than Chad Engine  

### Building
TGL is a single header library - there is nothing to build.   
But if you realy want to build something, you can compile the examples in `./src/examples/`,  
but note that they require Xlib.h, and are generally poorly written.
